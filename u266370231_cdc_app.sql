It is caused by an accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints and tissues, leading to inflammation and intense discomfort.</p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Uric acid is a waste product that forms when the body breaks down purines, which are found in certain foods and are also produced naturally by the body. Normally, uric acid dissolves in the blood and is excreted through the kidneys. However, in people with gout, the body either produces too much uric acid or has difficulties eliminating it, resulting in the formation of sharp crystals in the joints.</p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Gout typically affects the joint at the base of the big toe, but it can also occur in other joints such as the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists, and fingers. The onset of a gout attack is often sudden, with intense pain and swelling in the affected joint. The joint may become hot, tender to the touch, and red in color. Gout attacks can last for a few days to several weeks and may recur periodically.</p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">There are several risk factors for developing gout, including a family history of the disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, certain medications (such as diuretics), excessive alcohol consumption, and a diet high in purine-rich foods (such as red meat, seafood, and organ meats).</p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">The management of gout involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and pain management strategies. Lifestyle modifications may include maintaining a healthy weight, following a balanced diet low in purines, limiting alcohol intake, staying hydrated, and engaging in regular physical activity. Medications are often prescribed to reduce pain, inflammation, and uric acid levels in the blood.</p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">If left untreated, gout can lead to joint damage, deformities, and the development of tophi, which are lumps of uric acid crystals that can form beneath the skin.

MS is more common in women and typically first presents between the ages of 20 and 40.</p>  <h3 style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight:600;\">The characteristic features and symptoms of multiple sclerosis include:</h3> <ol> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Fatigue: Persistent and overwhelming fatigue is a common symptom in individuals with MS, often unrelated to physical exertion.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Motor symptoms: Weakness, muscle stiffness, tremors, lack of coordination, and problems with balance and walking can occur. Muscle spasms and difficulties with fine motor skills may also be present.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Sensory symptoms: Numbness, tingling, and abnormal sensations, such as the feeling of pins and needles, can affect various parts of the body.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Vision problems: Blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), or pain with eye movement can occur due to inflammation of the optic nerves (optic neuritis).</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Cognitive and emotional changes: MS can cause problems with memory, attention, and concentration. Changes in mood, such as depression or irritability, may also be experienced.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Bladder and bowel dysfunction: MS can lead to urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence, or difficulty emptying the bladder. Bowel dysfunction, including constipation or loss of bowel control, may also occur.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Sexual dysfunction: MS can affect sexual function and lead to decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, or difficulties with arousal or orgasm.</p> 	</li> </ol>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">The course of multiple sclerosis can vary from person to person. Some individuals experience relapsing-remitting MS, characterized by episodes of new or worsening symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remission). Others may have primary progressive MS, with a gradual progression of symptoms without distinct relapses and remissions. There are also secondary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS, which involve a combination of relapses and a steady decline in function.</p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Diagnosing multiple sclerosis can be complex and requires a combination of medical history, neurological examination, imaging tests (such as magnetic resonance imaging or MRI), and sometimes cerebrospinal fluid analysis.</p>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">While there is no cure for multiple sclerosis, various treatments can help manage symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve quality of life. Treatment options may include:</p>  <ol> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Disease-modifying therapies: These medications can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, delay disability progression, and decrease the number of new brain lesions.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Symptom management: Medications and therapies are available to address specific symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, fatigue, bladder dysfunction, and depression.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Rehabilitation: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help individuals with MS improve mobility, manage fatigue, and maintain independence.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Lifestyle measures: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress management, and adequate rest, can support overall well-being and symptom management.</p> 	</li> </ol>  <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Ongoing management of multiple sclerosis involves regular monitoring, communication with healthcare professionals, and adjustments to treatment plans as necessary.

If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to serious complications, including PID in women and epididymitis and infertility in men.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Syphilis: Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It progresses through several stages and can affect multiple organ systems. The primary stage is characterized by the appearance of a painless sore (chancre) at the site of infection. In the secondary stage, individuals may develop a rash, flu-like symptoms, and swollen lymph nodes. If left untreated, syphilis can progress to the latent and tertiary stages, which can cause severe complications such as damage to the heart, brain, and other organs.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection: HPV is a viral infection caused by the human papillomavirus.

Many individuals with HPV do not show any symptoms, and the infection often resolves on its own. HPV vaccines are available to protect against certain high-risk strains.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Herpes: Herpes infections are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), with HSV-1 primarily causing oral herpes (cold sores) and HSV-2 causing genital herpes. The infection can cause painful blisters or sores on or around the genitals or mouth. Outbreaks may occur periodically, and the virus can be transmitted even when no symptoms are present. There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications can help manage outbreaks and reduce transmission risk.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection: HIV is a viral infection that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (T cells). It can be transmitted through sexual contact, sharing needles, or during childbirth or breastfeeding.

Here is a comprehensive description of HPV and its associated diseases:</p>  <ol> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Genital Warts: Certain strains of HPV, known as low-risk HPV types, can cause genital warts. These warts may appear as small, flesh-colored bumps or clusters in the genital area, including the vulva, vagina, cervix, penis, or anus. They can also occur in the mouth or throat if the infection is transmitted through oral sex. Genital warts are usually painless, but they can cause itching, discomfort, and cosmetic concerns. While they do not typically lead to cancer, they can be a source of psychological distress.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Cervical Cancer: High-risk HPV types, particularly HPV 16 and 18, are strongly associated with the development of cervical cancer. Persistent infection with these high-risk strains can lead to the gradual development of precancerous lesions in the cervix, known as cervical dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). If left untreated, these precancerous lesions can progress to cervical cancer. Regular cervical cancer screening, such as Pap smears or HPV testing, is essential for early detection and treatment.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Other Cancers: In addition to cervical cancer, certain high-risk HPV types can also cause other types of cancer, including:</p>  	<ul> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Anal cancer: HPV infection, particularly in men who have sex with men, can increase the risk of developing anal cancer.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Oropharyngeal cancer: HPV infection, primarily through oral sex, has been linked to cancers of the throat, base of the tongue, and tonsils.</li> <li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Vulvar, Vaginal, and Penile Cancer: High-risk HPV types can also contribute to the development of vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancers, although these cancers are less common than cervical cancer.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP): RRP is a rare condition caused by HPV types 6 and 11. It involves the growth of benign tumors in the respiratory tract, including the larynx and vocal cords. RRP can cause hoarseness, difficulty breathing, and voice changes, particularly in children. While the tumors are noncancerous, they can lead to significant respiratory and voice problems and may require surgical removal.</p> 	</li> </ol> <h3 style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight:600;\">Prevention and Treatment:</h3>  <ul> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">HPV Vaccination: Vaccines are available to protect against certain high-risk HPV types that cause cervical cancer and genital warts. The vaccines are most effective when administered before exposure to the virus, typically during pre-adolescence or early adolescence. The vaccination is recommended for both males and females.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Safe Sexual Practices: Consistent and correct use of condoms can reduce the risk of HPV transmission, but they are not foolproof since HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom. Limiting sexual partners and choosing partners who have a lower risk of HPV can also help reduce the risk.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Regular Screening: Cervical cancer screening, such as Pap smears or HPV testing, is important for early detection of cervical abnormalities or cancer.

There are two main types of herpes viruses:</p>  <ol> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1): HSV-1 primarily causes oral herpes, which is commonly known as cold sores or fever blisters. Oral herpes is usually transmitted through direct contact with an active lesion or through sharing items like utensils, lip balms, or towels. It typically affects the mouth, lips, and face but can also involve the throat and, in some cases, the genital area through oral-genital contact. Recurrent outbreaks of oral herpes may be triggered by factors such as stress, illness, or sun exposure.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2): HSV-2 is responsible for most cases of genital herpes, a sexually transmitted infection. Genital herpes is usually transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person. It causes sores, blisters, or ulcers on or around the genitals, anus, or buttocks. Like oral herpes, genital herpes can have recurrent outbreaks triggered by factors such as stress, illness, or sexual activity. However, it&#39;s important to note that HSV-2 can also cause oral herpes through oral-genital contact.</p> 	</li> </ol>  <h3 style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight:600;\">Here are some important aspects related to herpes infections:</h3><ol> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Symptoms: The initial infection with HSV may cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, body aches, and swollen lymph nodes. After the initial infection, the virus remains in the body and can periodically reactivate, causing outbreaks of sores or blisters in the affected area. The sores can be painful, itchy, and may take several weeks to heal.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Transmission: HSV can be transmitted through direct contact with active sores or through asymptomatic shedding, where the virus is present on the skin or mucous membranes without visible symptoms. Sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex, is the most common mode of transmission. Sharing personal items, such as razors or towels, can also lead to transmission.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Complications: While herpes infections are generally not life-threatening, they can cause physical discomfort and emotional distress.

Here is a comprehensive description of eczema:</p>  <ol class=\"pl-3\"> 	<li> 	<p>Causes and Triggers:</p>  	<ul> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Genetic Factors: Eczema tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the condition.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Immune System Dysfunction: People with eczema have an overactive immune system that responds excessively to irritants and allergens.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Skin Barrier Dysfunction: Eczema is associated with defects in the skin&#39;s protective barrier, allowing moisture to escape and irritants to penetrate.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Environmental Triggers: Various environmental factors can exacerbate eczema symptoms, including dry air, hot or cold weather, exposure to irritants (such as chemicals or harsh soaps), allergens (such as pollen, pet dander, or dust mites), and certain fabrics or clothing materials.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Symptoms:</p>  	<ul> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Dry, sensitive skin: Eczema often causes dryness, roughness, and flakiness of the skin.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Itching: Intense itching is a hallmark symptom of eczema, leading to scratching that can further irritate the skin.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Redness and Inflammation: Affected skin areas may appear red, swollen, and inflamed.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Rashes and Lesions: Eczema rashes are typically patchy, may be raised or have a rough texture, and can develop blisters that may ooze or crust over.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Thickened, Leathery Skin: Over time, constant scratching and inflammation can lead to thickening and hardening of the skin in affected areas (known as lichenification).</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Types of Eczema:</p>  	<ul> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Atopic Dermatitis: The most common form of eczema, often associated with a family history of allergies or asthma.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Contact Dermatitis: Caused by direct contact with irritants or allergens, such as certain soaps, detergents, metals, or plants.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Nummular Dermatitis: Characterized by circular or coin-shaped patches of irritated skin.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Seborrheic Dermatitis: Affects areas rich in oil glands, such as the scalp (dandruff) or face (cradle cap in infants).</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Dyshidrotic Eczema: Manifests as small, itchy blisters on the palms, fingers, and soles of the feet.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Stasis Dermatitis: Occurs in the lower legs due to poor circulation and fluid buildup.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Treatment:</p>  	<ul> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Moisturizers: Regular and adequate use of moisturizers helps hydrate the skin, restore its barrier function, and reduce dryness and itching.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Topical Corticosteroids: These anti-inflammatory creams or ointments are commonly prescribed to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms during flare-ups.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors: Non-steroidal creams or ointments that help modulate the immune response and reduce inflammation.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Antihistamines: Oral antihistamines may be recommended to relieve itching and improve sleep.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Wet Wrap Therapy: In severe cases, wet wraps can be used to enhance the absorption of moisturizers and medications while providing a cooling effect.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Avoiding Triggers: Identifying and avoiding triggers that worsen eczema symptoms, such as certain foods, fabrics, or environmental factors.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Phototherapy: Controlled exposure to ultraviolet light, under medical supervision, can help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Systemic Medications: In severe or refr</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol>', 'Eczema.png'),
(99, 10, 'Skin cancer', '<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight:600;\">Skin cancer</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Skin cancer refers to the abnormal growth of skin cells, typically caused by the uncontrolled development of damaged skin cells. It is the most common type of cancer globally, and it primarily affects areas of the skin exposed to sunlight. There are several types of skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Here is a comprehensive description of skin cancer:</p>  <ol class=\"pl-3\"> 	<li> 	<p>Types of Skin Cancer:</p>  	<ul> 		<li> <p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC): BCC is the most common form of skin cancer. It usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, neck, scalp, and shoulders. BCC often appears as a raised, pearly bump or a pinkish patch of skin that may bleed or develop a crust. It grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.</p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): SCC is the second most common type of skin cancer. It typically occurs on sun-exposed areas but can also develop on scars, sores, or chronic skin ulcers. SCC often appears as a firm, red nodule, a scaly patch, or a sore that fails to heal. It may grow and spread more aggressively than BCC, potentially reaching nearby lymph nodes.</p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Melanoma: Melanoma is a less common but more aggressive type of skin cancer. It can develop from existing moles or appear as a new, unusual growth. Melanoma typically presents as an asymmetrical mole or lesion with irregular borders, varied coloration, and a larger diameter (greater than 6mm). Melanoma can spread to other parts of the body if not detected and treated early, making it potentially life-threatening.</p> 		</li> 		<li> 		<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Other Types: Other less common types of skin cancer include Merkel cell carcinoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and various rare skin lymphomas.</p> 		</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Risk Factors:</p>  	<ul> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation Exposure: Excessive exposure to UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds is the primary risk factor for skin cancer.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Fair Skin: People with lighter skin tones are more susceptible to skin damage from UV radiation.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Family History: Having a family history of skin cancer increases the risk.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Personal History: Previous skin cancer or precancerous skin lesions raise the likelihood of developing new skin cancers.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Immunosuppression: Weakened immune systems, such as those in organ transplant recipients or individuals with certain diseases, increase the risk.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Certain Moles or Skin Conditions: Having many moles or atypical moles, as well as certain inherited conditions like xeroderma pigmentosum or basal cell nevus syndrome, can increase the risk of developing skin cancer.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Symptoms:</p>  	<ul> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Changes in the Skin: Any changes in the appearance of the skin, such as the development of new moles or growths, changes in existing moles, or non-healing sores, should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Asymmetry: Irregular or asymmetric shape of moles or lesions.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Border Irregularity: Jagged or blurred edges of moles or lesions.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Color Variation: Moles or lesions with uneven coloration, such as different shades of brown, black, red, white, or blue.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Diameter: Moles or lesions larger than 6mm in diameter.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Evolution: Moles or lesions that change in size, shape, color, or texture over time.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Diagnosis:</p>  	<ul> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Visual Examination: A healthcare professional examines the skin, noting any suspicious areas.</li> 		<li style=\"text-align:justify;font-weight: normal;\">Skin Biopsy: If a suspicious lesion is found, a small sample of skin is removed for examination under a microscope to determine if cancer cells are present.</li> 	</ul> 	</li> </ol>', 'Skin cancer.png');
